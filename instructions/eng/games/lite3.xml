  <rules>Lite 3 is very similar to tic-tac-toe, with the change that each player can only have at most three of their markers on their board at a time.[br]The board starts empty. One player places X markers and the other player places O markers.[br]To move, choose an empty cell of the grid to place a marker. If you already have three markers on the board, then your least recently placed marker will disappear as soon as you have placed your newest marker, leaving its cell empty so that players can place a marker there in the future.[br]The first player to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three markers wins.[img src="lite3.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</rules>
