    <history>Tic-Tac-Two is a variation of tic-tac-toe published by Chicago-based game seller Marbles: The Brain Store. The objective of creating a three-in-a-row is the same, but players are also allowed to move the tic-tac-toe grid and the markers.</history>
    <board>Tic-Tac-Two is played on a five-row, five-column (25-cell) board with a movable tic-tac-toe (three-column, three-row) grid.[img src="a.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</board>
    <pieces>The first player has four "X" pieces and the second player has four "O" pieces to place.</pieces>

    <rules>At the start of the game, each player takes turns placing one of their pieces on any empty cell contained within the tic-tac-toe grid.[br]Once each player has placed at least two of their pieces, they may do one of three things on their turn: (1) place one of their remaining pieces on an empty cell within the tic-tac-toe grid, (2) move the tic-tac-toe grid such that it is centered at a cell one space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally away from the cell it was originally centered at, or (3) move one of their pieces that is already on the board (regardless of whether it is within the tic-tac-toe grid) to any empty cell within the grid.[br]The first player to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their own pieces contained within the tic-tac-toe grid wins. If in a single move the grid has been moved such that it contains both a three-in-a-row of X pieces and a three-in-a-row of O pieces, then the game is a tie.[img src="b.svg" alt="b" width="300" height="300"]</rules>
