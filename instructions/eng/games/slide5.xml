    <towin/>
    <rules>Inserting a chip into a slot causes pieces in the row to which that slot is an entrance to slide down.[img src="a.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="250"]Inserting a chip into a filled-up row causes the bottommost chip in the row to fall out of the grid. Chips that fall out of the grid can be placed again.[img src="b.svg" alt="b" width="300" height="250"]To win, form a line of five of your pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.[img src="c.svg" alt="c" width="300" height="250"]It is possible to create a five-in-a-row for your opponent, in which case you lose.[br]It is also possible in a single move to create a five-in-a-row for both you and your opponent. If you create a five-in-a-row for yourself and your opponent in a single move, then you win. Variations of this rule are explained in the Variants section.</rules>
