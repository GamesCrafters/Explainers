  <history>Shift Tac Toe was first released in 1988 by Pressman games.</history>
  <board>Shift-tac-toe is played on a standing three-row, three-column grid with slots for the pieces to be inserted from the top. As the game progresses, players may shift one of the rows on their turn. A row is able to be shifted at most one space to the left and at most one space to the right from its starting position.</board>
  <pieces>The first player has five black disks to place and the second player has five red disks to place.</pieces>
  <tomove>On their turn, a player either inserts one of their disks into an open column or shifts one of the rows. When placing a disk in the column, the disk will fall to the lowest available row on top of any other disks that were placed in the column. One may not insert a disk into a column already containing three disks. When shifting a row, (1) any piece shifted away from the main three-row, three-column grid drops out of the board and is returned to its owner and (2) some disks in above rows may fall one row lower if the row-shift opens up spaces below them.</tomove>
  <towin>Be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your disks.</towin>
