    <rules>There are N tiles numbered 1 to N on an X-row, Y-column board, such that N is one less than the product of X and Y (there is always one space on the board not occupied by a tile). Most often, the board is square, so X=Y and N is one less than a square number.[br]The tiles are arranged randomly on the board at the start of the puzzle.[br]To move, slide any tile adjacent to the empty space to the empty space.[br]The puzzle is solved when the tiles are arranged in row-major order. Specificially, the puzzle is solved when for each tile, if the tile is numbered n, then it is at the nth cell of the board according to 1-indexed row-major order.[img src="a.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</rules>
