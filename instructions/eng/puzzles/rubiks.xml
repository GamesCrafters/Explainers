    <rules>An NxNxN Rubik's Cube is a cube-shaped structure with six faces, each divided into N² smaller surface squares, totaling 6N² colored surface squares. Initially, when the cube is scrambled, each face consists of a jumbled assortment of colors.[br]To move, rotate an individual layer of the cube. Each turn of a layer rotates an entire row or column of squares.[br]The objective of the puzzle is to arrange the colors on each face so that each side of the cube is a single, solid color.</rules>
