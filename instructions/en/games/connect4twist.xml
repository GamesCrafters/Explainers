    <history>Connect Four Twist and Turn is a modern variant of the classic Connect Four, released by Hasbro. Its key innovation is the introduction of rotating columns, which dramatically changes positional tactics and increases game-tree complexity compared to the standard version.</history>
    <board>A standard Connect Four grid (vertical, 4x4 or 4x5), but each entire column can be rotated 90° when the player chooses the “twist” action. Rotation shifts the alignment of pieces but does not cause pieces to fall, creating dynamic board states.</board>
    <pieces>Both sides have the same number of pieces as the grid. Pieces are placed into the top of any column (classic gravity mechanic).</pieces>
    <tomove>On your turn, you drop a piece and, optionally, rotate any one row.</tomove>
    <towin>First player to create a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line of 4 pieces of their color wins.</towin>

        <strategy>
            <name>Momentum Control Through Rotation</name>
            <description>By rotating, you can disrupt your opponent's three-in-a-row chances or create your own potential four-in-a-row. A single rotation can often create a sudden opportunity, and even directly lead to a winning situation.</description>
        </strategy>
        <strategy>
            <name>Column Commitment Punish</name>
            <description>If your opponent stacks multiple pieces in a certain column, by rotating that column at the right moment, you can disperse their arrangement, rendering their previous efforts in vain.</description>
