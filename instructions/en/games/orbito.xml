    <history/>
    <board>Orbito is played on a 4x4 board, with the outer spaces rotating counterclockwise and the inner spaces rotating depending on the variant. There is also a button in the center that rotates the board after each turn.</board>
    <pieces>Player 1 plays with black marbles and Player 2 plays with white marbles.</pieces>
    <tomove>On each turn a player can optionally move their opponent's piece with an empty adjacent square (or a diagonal square using that variant). Next, choose an empty space to place their own piece. Then, rotate the board one place by pushing the button.</tomove>
    <towin>The first player to achieve 4 in a row with their pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If both players achieve 4 in a row on the same turn. Tiebreaker: If the board fills up and no player has achieved 4 in a row the board will rotate at most 5 times, the first player to get 4 in a row within those 5 rotations will win. If no 4 in a row occurs then the game will be tied.</towin>

        <strategy>
            <name>Center Grid Control</name>
            <description>Secure the inner 2x2 grid early to create a stable foundation to ensure the most chances for a 4-in-a-row. The pieces rotate within themselves and are harder for opponents to displace.</description>
        </strategy>
        <strategy>
            <name>Outer Orbit Dominance</name>
            <description>Focus on controlling the 12 outer edge positions, the rotating perimeter, to maximize positional advantage and flexibility. Outer pieces cycle through more of the board after each rotation, creating many 4-in-a-row alignment opportunities. Avoid placing pieces in the inner 2x2 grid unless necessary to block critical moves.</description>
        </strategy>
        <strategy>
            <name>Rotation Baiting / Chess-Orbito</name>
            <description>Intentionally create near-winning positions, post-spin 3-in-a-row, that will complete after 1-2 rotations. This will force your opponent to either block preemptively or move your piece to safe positions to avoid losing. Creating “fake out” 3-in-a-row pieces that occupy your opponent's focus while you build a secondary win they can't address in time.</description>

    <variants>
        <variant>
            <name>Regular</name>
            <description>Players can only move their opponents pieces to orthogonal adjacent empty squares. Both outer and inner spaces rotate counter-clockwise.</description>
        </variant>
        <variant>
            <name>Inner Clockwise</name>
            <description>Players can only move their opponents pieces to orthogonal adjacent empty squares. Outer spaces rotate counter-clockwise, as normal, while the inner spaces rotate clockwise.</description>
        </variant>
        <variant>
            <name>Diagonal Moves</name>
            <description>Players can move their opponents' pieces to any adjacent empty square (including diagonals). Both outer and inner spaces rotate counterclockwise.</description>
        </variant>
        <variant>
            <name>Diagonal Moves and Inner Clockwise</name>
            <description>Players can move their opponents' pieces to any adjacent empty square (including diagonals). Outer spaces rotate counterclockwise while the inner spaces rotate clockwise.</description>
        </variant>
        <variant>
            <name>Misere</name>
            <description>The winning condition is flipped: you lose if you get 4 in a row.</description>
