  <history>Toot and Otto is a game similar to Connect 4 made by ThinkFun.</history>
  <board>Toot and Otto is played on a standing four-row, six-column grid with slots at the top of each column for inserting pieces. The board is empty at the start of the game.</board>
  <pieces>There are two types of pieces in Toot and Otto - the T and the O. Each player has six Ts and six Os to place on the board.</pieces>
  <tomove>On your turn, insert one of your pieces into one of the columns. The piece will fall to the lowest available row in the column. A piece cannot be inserted into a column that is full.</tomove>
  <towin/>
  <rules>One player will have the name "TOOT", and the other player will have the name "OTTO". "TOOT" plays first.[br]The first player to get their name - either "TOOT" or "OTTO", depending on which player they are - spelled on the board horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is the winner. It is possible for a player to complete the opponent's name for them, in which case the opponent wins. The game is a tie if "TOOT" and "OTTO" are simultaneously completed in a single move or if all pieces have been placed and neither TOOT nor OTTO has been spelled.</rules>
