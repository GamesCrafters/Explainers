    <rules>Kayles is played with an arbitrary number of bowling pins arranged in a line. The pins are all standing at the beginning of the game.[br]Each player, on their turn, either knocks over any one pin or knocks over any two adjacent pins.[br]Two pins are considered adjacent only if they are next to each other at the beginning of the game; if two pins were not next to each other at the start of the game, they are not considered adjacent even if all pins between them have been knocked over.[br]A player wins by leaving their opponent without any pins to knock over.
