    <history/>
    <board>A board with 8 slots. A slot is filled if a penny sits in the place. A slot is interconnected with two slots that have index increase by 3 and mod 8 and index increase by 5 and mod 8 (For example, slot 1 is connected with slot 4 ((1+3)%8) and slot 6 ((1+5)%8)).</board>
    <pieces>Played with 7 pennies.</pieces>
    <tomove>On each turn, the player must add one penny to any empty slot, and then slide it to another empty slot.</tomove>
    <towin>Fit a total of 7 pennies on the board.</towin>
    <rules>The player should begin the game with an add move, and continue the add -&gt; slide circle repeatedly until the game ends. If the player adds a penny to the board and there is no adjacent empty slot to slide the penny to, the player loses the game (No matter how many pennies on the board).</rules>
