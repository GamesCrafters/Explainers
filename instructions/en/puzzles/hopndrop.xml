    <history/>
    <board>Stacks containing a positive number of panels are arranged in a 2D array such that there is a path from one stack to another other that (1) consists only of orthogonal connections and (2) travels along other stacks of panels. There is a one-panel stack designated as the start panel, where the character starts.</board>
    <pieces/>
    <tomove>The character hops to an orthogonally adjacent stack of panels. Subtract one panel from the stack that the character hopped from, unless the character hopped from the start panel.</tomove>
    <towin/>
    <rules>The puzzle is incomplete if the character hops into a space containing no panels. The puzzle is solved if the character returns to the start panel and all other panels have been cleared.</rules>
