  <rules>The game starts with six dots/vertices.[br]The first player, on their turn, draws a blue line between two dots that do not yet have a line drawn between them. The second player, on their turn, draws a red line between two dots that do not yet have a line drawn between them. An edge between two dots may not be drawn or colored twice.[br]A player loses when they create a triangle whose sides are all the same color. Specifically, this triangle must be one whose vertices are three of the six original dots; any triangles with a vertex that is an intersection of two drawn lines that is not one of the original six vertices does not count.[img src="sim.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]In the above example, the player drawing blue lines loses because they created a triangle whose sides are all blue.</rules>
