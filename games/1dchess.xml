    <gameplay>Moves are like those of regular chess, except for how knights move. A player may move the knight two spaces to either the left or the right (regardless of whether there is a piece between the departure and destination spaces) as long as the destination space is unoccupied and as long as doing so does not put their own king in check. There is no castling.</gameplay>
    <endofgame>A player wins when they checkmate the opponent's king. Note that draws by stalemate are possible. For example, stalemate can be achieved in one move if white captures black's rook.</endofgame>
