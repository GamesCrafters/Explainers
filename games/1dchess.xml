    <history/>
    <board>The game is played on a 1x8 chessboard.</board>
    <pieces>The first player has a white king, knight, and rook. The second player has a black king, knight, and rook. The pieces are initially arranged as follows...[img src="1dchessa.svg" alt="1dchessa" width="200"]</pieces>
    <tomove>Moves are like those of regular chess, except for how knights move. A player may move the knight two spaces to either the left or the right (regardless of whether there is a piece between the departure and destination spaces) as long as the destination space is unoccupied and as long as doing so does not put their own king in check.</tomove>
    <towin>A player wins when they checkmate the opponent's king. Note that draws by stalemate are possible. For example, stalemate can be achieved in one move if white captures black's rook.</towin>
    <rules>There is no castling.</rules>
