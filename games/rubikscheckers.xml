  <history>Rubik's Checkers is a game that is similar to checkers. The popular Rubik's games were originally invented by Ern√∂ Rubik.</history>
  <board>The standard Rubik's Checkers board is a variable grid of squares.&#13;
Starting position: A specific number of kings for each player on opposite sides of the board.</board>
  <pieces>There are two pieces - kings and men. Kings become men when jumped over by a king.</pieces>
  <tomove>Each player takes turns making one valid move.&#13;
Valid Moves:&#13;
Kings may move diagonally, forward, or backward. A king may jump over an opponent's piece if the space it jumps to is empty. Multiple jumps are possible (like in regular checkers). When a king jumps over an opponent's king, that king is demoted to a man. If the king jumps over an opponent's man, then that man is removed from the board. When a player's king jumps over the same player's man, that man is promoted back to a king.&#13;
A man may only move backwards, not forward. A man cannot jump or capture any piece.&#13;
On your turn, a piece in your home row may be promoted to a King.</tomove>
  <towin>Eliminate all of the opponents pieces or prevent them from moving.</towin>
  <rules>Players alternate making legal moves.</rules>
