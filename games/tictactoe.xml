  <history>Tic-tac-toe, also known as Naughts and Crosses, is one of the most widely known games. Found everywhere from the temples of ancient Egypt to the medieval cathedrals of England, tic-tac-toe has entertained people for centuries. While tic-tac-toe is now considered a child's game, it was not always the case. In the past, the game was linked to pagan rituals dedicated to the magic properties of the nine-square grid. The grid was known as the Magic Square because the numbers 1-9 could be arranged so that their sum is the same horizontally, diagonally or vertically. During the Middle Ages, the Magic Square was known by secret societies as the Cabala of the Nine Chambers. They believed that the Magic Square held a numerological message about the world. Today, the game is more known as a simple childhood pastime. While in the United States, the game is known as tic-tac-toe, the original name of "Tit-Tat-Toe" comes to us from the 16th century. Tit by itself means to slap and a "tit for tat" is retaliation. Toe, which is the third piece placed makes the winning combination by securing the other two pieces. Tic-tac-toe reached stardom on the big screen in the Hollywood film Wargames, where tic-tac-toe was used to teach a super-computer about no-win situations.</history>
  <board>Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-row, three-column grid.</board>
  <tomove>One player on their turn draws an "X" mark on an empty space, while the other player on their turn draws an "O" mark on an empty space.</tomove>
  <towin>A player wins when they create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their marks.</towin>
  <rules>If all nine spaces are filled and neither player has created a three-in-a-row, the game is a tie.[img src="tictactoe.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</rules>

      <description>While the game is a tie in perfect play, there are certain strategies that can be used against an imperfect player. Try to place your marks on 3 corners or on the center and two corners; you may be able to set up a double-win for yourself. If you are threatening a completion of two lines of three, your opponent can only stop you from completing one of them.</description>

      <name>Jam</name>
      <description>A game similar to tic-tac-toe, discussed in Berlekamp, Conway and Guy (1982), Jam was created by John Michon. Jam is different from tic-tac-toe in that the game is drawn with 8 towns connected by 9 straight roads. The winner is the first player to take all the roads through any one of the towns.</description>
    </variant>
    <variant>
      <name>Two-Part Tic-tac-toe</name>
      <description>Each player has three pieces which they place on the board. Players alternate turns in an attempt to make three in a row. However, once all pieces are placed, each player alternates sliding pieces to an empty square. Each player may move their piece either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game ends when a player gets three in a row or the game ends in a stalemate.</description>
    </variant>
    <variant>
      <name>Two-Part Tic-tac-toe With Jumps</name>
      <description>Similar rules to Two-Part Tic-tac-toe except that players are allowed to jump over their opponent's pieces to land in an empty square adjacent to their opponent's piece.</description>
    </variant>
    <variant>
      <name>Three-Dimensional Tic-tac-toe</name>
      <description>3 boards are drawn one on top of each other. Players attempt to either make three in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally on any one of the grids or through all three grids.</description>
