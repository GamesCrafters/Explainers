  <history>Bagh-Chal, which means "Change of Tigers" or "Tigers' Moves", originates from Nepal. As the country's national game, Bagh-Chal was created by Himalayan herders, whose job the game resembles. The game, which has been played for more than a thousand years, is played by some shepherds on a grid scrapped into dirt with stones used as bagh (tigers) and pebbles symbolizing bakhri (goats).</history>
  <board>The game is played on a hexagonal tiling, as shown in the following image:[img src="a.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</board>
  <pieces>Each player controls three bees. The bees are placed at the ends of board at the start of the game, as in the following image:[img src="beeline.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</pieces>
  <tomove>Move one of your bees in any of the six directions away from its current hexagon. The bee must move as many spaces in the chosen direction as it can without hitting another bee or the edge of the board. There is no capturing; bees are never removed from the board. Examples of how the bees should move are presented in the animation below.[img src="c.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]</tomove>
  <towin>Trap your opponent's bees, i.e., leave your opponent with no legal moves.</towin>
