  Players take turns selecting a portion of a 4-row, 7-column (or, more generally, m-row, n-column) chocolate bar to eat. The bottom-left square of the chocolate bar is the poison square.[img src="chomp.svg" alt="a" width="300" height="300"]A player eats a section of the chocolate bar on their turn. Specifically, they select any uneaten square of the chocolate bar aside from the poison square, resulting in all squares located on or to the right of the selected square's row being eaten. A player loses if there are no edible squares left to eat, i.e., only the poison square remains.
