# Old Game Instructions Directory

The most up-to-date, currently used game instructions are NOT in this directory but instead in `Explainers/instructions`.

This directory (`Explainers/oldinstructions`) contains outdated game instructions. However, there are games that are in this directory that are not in the new directory because we haven't updated the instructions and moved them yet. 

Updating the game instructions in this directory then moving them to the new directory is a TODO.
