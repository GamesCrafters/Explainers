  <history>Atari Go was first introduced by Yasuda Tasutoshi, an 8 Dan professional Go player. It is a 2 player, simplified version of Go, invented especially for beginning players to learn about the tactical fundamentals of Go.</history>
  <board>The game of Go is played on a grid board. The size of the board may vary depending on the players' preference. Some can be 19x19, 13x13, 9x9, etc.</board>
  <pieces>There are two colored stones, black and white.</pieces>
  <tomove>A move consists of the player putting one of their pieces on an empty intersection of the board.</tomove>
  <towin>The first player to capture one or more pieces (depending on how many pieces you and your opponent want) wins.</towin>
  <rules>The rules for Atari Go are similar to those of regular Go. The player with the black stones moves first. Both players alternatively move, however, once a stone is placed on the board, the player is not allowed to move it. The only way that stones can be moved is being captured. Capturing is when one f your or your opponent's piece is surrounded.</rules>
