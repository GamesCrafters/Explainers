  <history>Tile Chess is a chess variant that was made by Jason Wittman during the late 80's as part of a project for his art class. This game is a cross between chess and dominoes.</history>
  <board>The standard Tile Chess board is infinitely big.&#13;
Starting position: Nothing on the board. Each player chooses a color and begins placing pieces down, one at a time, taking turns to do so. The pieces must be connected to each other (either adjacent to a piece of your color or an opponent's).</board>
  <pieces>There are 16 tiles for each color (player) and consists of all chess pieces (king, rook, queen, pawn, bishop, and knight).</pieces>
  <tomove>Each player takes turns making one valid move.&#13;
Valid Moves:&#13;
All pieces move in the same was as regular chess, with a few exceptions. You may jump over your own pieces with pieces other than the knight. Pawns can move, as well as capture, forwards and backwards. In addition, you cannot capture a piece and make an island (a piece that is not connect to the main link of pieces).</tomove>
  <towin>Checkmate the opponent's king. If playing with more than 2 players, then when one player is checkmated by you, you gain control of his or her tiles.</towin>
