  <board>Honeycomb shaped board that starts with 3 spaces on top, five in the middle and 3 on the bottom of the board.</board>
  <pieces>Each player has 10 stones of his color plus 10 neutral pieces.</pieces>

  <towin>To get three in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.</towin>
  <rules>Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. On the player's turn they may either place a neutral piece on an empty spot or they may put a stone of their color on top of a neutral piece. The player is also able to pass if they are not able to legally place a piece. The first person to get three in a row of their color wins. If, however, they use up all their stones without managing a win, the player loses.</rules>
